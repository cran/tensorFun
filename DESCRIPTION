Description: Basic functions to handle higher-order tensor data. See Kolda and Bader (2009) <doi:10.1137/07070111X> for details on tensor. While existing packages on tensor data extend the base 'array' class to some S4 classes, this package serves as an alternative resort to handle tensor only as 'array' class.
    Some functionalities related to missingness and rearrangement, discussed in Bai and Ng (2021) <arXiv:1910.06677>, are also supported.
